# Content Statuses

There should be a draft indicator above. This is enabled with the `status` key
in the front matter:

```markdown
---
status: draft
---
```

Supported statuses:

- draft -> Rough draft
- in-progress -> In progress
- ready -> Ready for review
- verified -> Verified

These statuses are the default for each Confluence space. Support of custom
status may be possible in the future.
